ingress-edge.callbacks — render the shared OIDC callback host google-sso.<domain> for every entry in
ingressEdge.callbackDomains. Only 04_google_sso calls this (`{{ include "ingress-edge.callbacks" . }}`); it
ships the matching whoami backend + the sealed OAuth secret. Each callback is just an SSO ingress whose one
host IS google-sso.<domain> and whose redirectURL therefore derives to itself — so its SecurityPolicy is
what completes the OAuth token exchange and sets the domain-scoped session cookie. No allowlist (the whoami
is deny-all except the intercepted /oauth2/callback path). ctx: the root `.`.
