# 16 — Grafana

> **2026-06 — Grafana now also OWNS alerting** (no Alertmanager, no vmalert). On top of dashboards it
> provisions, as code: two **datasources** (VictoriaMetrics, type `prometheus`, uid `VictoriaMetrics`;
> VictoriaLogs, the signed `victoriametrics-logs-datasource` plugin, uid `VictoriaLogs` — UIDs match the
> k8s-stack defaults so synced dashboards resolve), a **contact point** (Gmail email), a **notification
> policy**, and an **alert rule group** (node NotReady, high node mem/CPU, pod CrashLoopBackOff, PVC >85%,
> target down, + a VictoriaLogs error-rate alert). The Gmail app-password is sealed by
> `16_grafana_smtp/16_grafana_smtp.sh` → `grafana-smtp` Secret → `GF_SMTP_PASSWORD` (optional). Grafana
> alert *rules* are file-provisioned (survive restart); alert *state* resets on restart (no PVC). The
> datasources sidecar is OFF (datasources are provisioned directly); the **dashboards** sidecar stays ON
> and ingests the k8s-stack's `grafana_dashboard` ConfigMaps. The note below predates the VM migration —
> "Prometheus/Alertmanager UIs" now read **vmui/VictoriaLogs UIs**, and the datasource is VictoriaMetrics.

Standalone **Grafana**, the dashboards/Explore UI for the monitoring core ([15_monitoring.md](15_monitoring.md)).
The kube-prometheus-stack's bundled Grafana was left **off**, but the stack still emits its curated
dashboard + datasource ConfigMaps — so Grafana lands here as its own app and the sidecar picks them up
with zero rework. Grafana's **own login is disabled** (anonymous Admin); the only barrier is **Google
SSO at the shared Gateway**, the same front door as the Prometheus/Alertmanager UIs. **No persistence.**

## Decisions

### Standalone chart, not the stack's subchart
Same `grafana/grafana` chart, run on its own (release `grafana`, namespace `monitoring`) — no feature
loss vs. the bundled subchart, but it versions, syncs and rolls back independently of the stack. Thin
wrapper-chart pattern as everywhere else: version pinned in `Chart.yaml` (`grafana/grafana` **10.5.15**,
appVersion **12.3.1**), all config in `values.yaml` under the `grafana:` key, `Chart.lock` committed.
The chart ships **no CRDs**, so — unlike the prometheus-operator — there's nothing to hoist into the
wave-0 CRDs app.

### Datasource + dashboards from the sidecar
`sidecar.datasources` + `sidecar.dashboards` enabled with `searchNamespace: ALL`, matching the stack's
default labels (`grafana_datasource` / `grafana_dashboard`). The stack already emits the Prometheus
datasource (pointing at `http://kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus.monitoring.svc:9090`) and its curated
dashboards, so **nothing is hardcoded here** — the sidecar provisions them on every start.

### No persistence (`persistence.enabled: false`)
Explicit requirement. Safe because Grafana holds no state worth keeping: the datasource and curated
dashboards are re-provisioned from ConfigMaps each start. **Trade-off:** dashboards or settings a user
creates *in the UI* are lost on pod restart. If that ever matters, add a small `longhorn` PVC — but
that's deliberately not done.

### Auth off → Google SSO is the only gate
`auth.anonymous.enabled: true` with `org_role: Admin`, `disable_login_form: true`, `auth.basic` off.
Every request reaches Grafana already authenticated at the edge by the Gateway's Google SSO (the
`sso: pontiki.app` HTTPRoute + the `04_google_sso` SecurityPolicy = Google login + the email allowlist),
so there's no second login and the user lands straight in the UI. **Anonymous Admin** means everyone on
the SSO allowlist gets full Grafana admin (edit/delete dashboards, add datasources) — acceptable for a
small, trusted allowlist; the gateway allowlist is the real boundary. Identical posture to the
Prometheus/Alertmanager UIs, which also have no login of their own.

### Exposure ships inside this chart
The Grafana edge now lives in the **`07_grafana` chart itself** (folded in from the retired standalone
`07_monitoring_ingress`): the `ingress:` block in `values.yaml` + `templates/edge-*.yaml` render its own
`grafana` Gateway (a single `:443` listener, folded onto the one Envoy via `mergeGateways`), the Certificate
(HTTP-01), the `sso`-labelled HTTPRoute, and a cross-namespace ReferenceGrant to the `grafana` Service —
exactly the same per-UI pattern the vmui/vlogs UIs ship in their own stacks. `letsencrypt-staging` until the
cert issues, then flip `ingress.issuer` in this chart's `values.yaml` to `letsencrypt-prod`.

### sync-wave 7
Same wave as the stack it reads ConfigMaps from (`07_victoria_metrics_k8s_stack`) and the other two
monitoring stacks. The sidecar is a continuous watcher, so no hard "after the stack" ordering is needed;
shipping the edge in this same app also lets its HTTPRoute's `backendRef` resolve the instant the `grafana`
Service appears, instead of sitting `ResolvedRefs:False` across a wave boundary. The `NN` prefix == the
wave, so the app/chart are `07_grafana` (a third wave-7 app).

## Apply / verify

1. Ensure a `grafana.pontiki.app` A-record points at the router (the `*.pontiki.app` forward already
   covers `:80`/`:443` to the Gateway IP).
2. `git add -A && git commit && git push`. ArgoCD syncs the new listener, cert, route and Grafana pod.
3. `kubectl -n argocd get applications` → `grafana` **Synced + Healthy**.
4. `kubectl -n monitoring get deploy,pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana` → Running;
   `kubectl -n monitoring get pvc` → none for grafana.
5. `kubectl -n gateway get certificate grafana` → `READY=True`; `kubectl -n gateway get httproute grafana`
   → `Accepted` / `ResolvedRefs=True` (briefly False until the pod is up — self-clears).
6. Browse `https://grafana.pontiki.app` → **Google SSO login** first (allowlist enforced); after login,
   Grafana opens straight into the UI with **no Grafana login** (anonymous Admin). Connections → Data
   sources shows Prometheus; the stack's curated dashboards are listed.
7. Once the staging cert issues, flip this chart's `ingress.issuer` to `letsencrypt-prod`, push, and
   re-verify the cert is trusted.

## Caveats
- **No persistence is intentional** — see the decision above; UI-created content does not survive a
  restart.
- **Anonymous Admin** — every SSO-allowlisted user is a full Grafana admin. Lock down with a `Viewer`
  default role (`auth.anonymous.org_role`) if that's ever too broad.
