# 09: Monitoring & observability

VictoriaMetrics + VictoriaLogs are the metrics+logs backend (one operator reconciles both), Grafana
is the UI and alerting front over them, and metrics-server serves the narrow in-tree resource-metrics
API (`kubectl top`, HPA) that the observability stack deliberately doesn't. Ingress and SSO for each UI
live in [07_ingress.md](07_ingress.md); storage classes in [08_storage.md](08_storage.md).

## VictoriaMetrics & VictoriaLogs

vmagent (Deployment, `selectAllByDefault`) scrapes everything into a `VMSingle` (1x, 50Gi longhorn PVC,
180d retention) exposed via vmui. A `victoria-logs-collector` DaemonSet on all 3 nodes remote-writes to a
`VLSingle` (1x, 30Gi longhorn PVC, 60d retention) exposed via vlogs. The VM operator reconciles the VM*/VL*
CRs and converts prometheus-operator objects.

### Why VictoriaMetrics over Prometheus
One operator covers both metrics (VM*) and logs (VL*), far lighter than Prometheus+Loki on 8GB Pi 5 nodes,
and PromQL-compatible so dashboards/queries port unchanged.

### The prometheus-operator CRD converter
The operator's prometheus converter turns every existing `ServiceMonitor`/`PodMonitor`/`PrometheusRule`/`Probe`
into its VM equivalent (`VMServiceScrape`/`VMPodScrape`/...) with no rewrites. That is why the coreos
`monitoring.coreos.com` CRDs are kept, the wave-0 `00_prometheus_operator_crds` app is the converter's
source, not removable. Scrape sources across the platform (node-exporter, kube-state-metrics, cilium/hubble,
argocd, cert-manager, longhorn, sealed-secrets, cnpg, metrics-server, ...) all reach vmagent this way. The
converter stamps ArgoCD-ignore annotations on its output
(`operator.prometheus_converter_add_argocd_ignore_annotations: true`) so ArgoCD never fights or prunes
operator-created objects.

### Grafana owns alerting
`vmalert` and `vmalertmanager` are OFF; Grafana provisions the contact point + notification policy + alert
rules as code (see below). No Alertmanager. Dropping vmalert means the stack's default recording/alerting
VMRules are not created (`defaultRules.create: false`); Grafana alert expressions are inlined PromQL.

### Talos control-plane scrapes (outside ArgoCD)
kube-controller-manager (:10257), kube-scheduler (:10259) (both https, self-signed → `insecureSkipVerify`)
and etcd (:2381, plain http, Talos `listen-metrics-urls`) are exposed via **Talos machine config, applied
OUTSIDE ArgoCD** — they're machine-level, not a chart — and scraped by static `endpoints` at the CP node IPs
(192.168.10.201-203). kube-proxy is OFF (Cilium replaces it). apiserver/etcd high-cardinality histograms are
dropped via `metricRelabelConfigs`.

### Other decisions
Both VMSingle and VLSingle PVCs use the `longhorn` (replica-3) class. Metrics retention 180d, logs 60d
(logs are bulkier, their own shorter window). Metrics start fresh (no `vmctl` backfill). The logs store is
the operator `VLSingle` CR (one operator for everything), not the standalone logs chart. node-exporter and
the log collector are DaemonSets with `tolerations: [{operator: Exists}]` — this is an all-control-plane
cluster, so a `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: DoesNotExist` selector would match ZERO nodes.

Each UI (vmui, vlogs) is exposed by the consolidated platform-ingress app (wave 6) behind Google SSO,
not by its own chart; see [07_ingress.md](07_ingress.md). The Hubble UI (`hubble.<domain>`) rides the same
platform-ingress app. Cilium/Hubble also ships Grafana dashboards: `hubble.metrics.dashboards.enabled` in
`00_cilium` emits `grafana_dashboard` ConfigMaps that this stack's Grafana sidecar picks up cluster-wide (see
[04_networking.md](04_networking.md)).

### Pinned versions

Chart versions live in each app's `Chart.yaml` (Renovate groups the VictoriaMetrics charts —
operator-crds, operator, k8s-stack, logs-collector — and bumps them together). Two constraints:

- `victoria-metrics-operator-crds` and `victoria-metrics-operator` must ship the SAME operator app
  version; bump them together.
- `00_prometheus_operator_crds` is kept as the converter's source — do not remove it.

## Grafana

Standalone `grafana/grafana` chart (release `grafana`, ns `monitoring`, chart `05_grafana`, no persistence):
the dashboards/Explore UI over the two datasources and the owner of alerting. Run on its own rather than as
the k8s-stack subchart so it versions/syncs/rolls back independently, no feature loss.

### Provisioned as code
- Two datasources: VictoriaMetrics (type `prometheus`, uid `VictoriaMetrics`) and VictoriaLogs (the signed
  `victoriametrics-logs-datasource` plugin, uid `VictoriaLogs`). UIDs match the k8s-stack defaults so synced
  dashboards resolve. The **datasources sidecar is OFF** (provisioned directly); the **dashboards sidecar
  stays ON** (`searchNamespace: ALL`) and ingests the k8s-stack's `grafana_dashboard` ConfigMaps on every
  start.
- Contact point (Gmail email), notification policy, and an alert rule group (node NotReady, high node
  mem/CPU, pod CrashLoopBackOff, PVC >85%, target down, plus a VictoriaLogs error-rate alert). Rules are
  file-provisioned (survive restart); alert *state* resets on restart (no PVC).

### No persistence (`persistence.enabled: false`)
Explicit requirement, safe because Grafana holds no state worth keeping: datasources + curated dashboards
re-provision each start, alert rules are file-provisioned. Trade-off: UI-created dashboards/settings and
alert state are lost on pod restart. Add a small `longhorn` PVC if that ever matters; deliberately not done.

### Anonymous Admin, gated by SSO
`auth.anonymous.enabled: true` with `org_role: Admin`, `disable_login_form: true`, basic auth off. Every
request reaches Grafana already authenticated at the edge (the Gateway's Google SSO + email allowlist), so
there's no second login. This is only safe because the edge gates it: anonymous Admin means every
SSO-allowlisted user is a full Grafana admin — acceptable for a small trusted allowlist, the gateway
allowlist is the real boundary. Drop `auth.anonymous.org_role` to `Viewer` if that's ever too broad.

### SMTP secret
Grafana's Gmail app-password comes from `SMTP_GOOGLE_APP_PASSWORD_SECRET` in the gitignored `.env`; `lib/shell/09_grafana_smtp.sh`
seals it into the `grafana-smtp` Secret (key `password`), surfaced as `GF_SMTP_PASSWORD` (optional, so Grafana starts
before it's sealed). Leave the var empty and the script offers to delete the sealed file (disables outgoing email).
Host/user/from are non-secret in the values. This is the only imperative script for this step; the VM stack
and metrics-server are pure GitOps.

Grafana's `grafana.ops.pontiki.app` edge (Gateway + Certificate + SSO HTTPRoute) is served by the consolidated
platform-ingress app (wave 6), not the `05_grafana` chart; see [07_ingress.md](07_ingress.md).

### Verify
```bash
kubectl -n monitoring get deploy,pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana   # Running; no PVC
# Browse https://grafana.ops.pontiki.app -> Google SSO first, then straight into the UI (anonymous Admin).
# Connections -> Data sources shows VictoriaMetrics + VictoriaLogs; curated dashboards listed.
```

## metrics-server

The observability stack collects rich custom metrics but does **not** serve `metrics.k8s.io`, the narrow
in-tree resource-metrics contract that HPA, `kubectl top`, and the scheduler expect from an aggregated
APIService. [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) fills exactly that gap: it
scrapes each kubelet's Summary API over HTTPS (`:10250`) and registers `v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io`. Thin
wrapper chart at `argo_apps/platform/charts/02_metrics_server/` (chart pinned in `Chart.yaml`),
single replica, 50m/100Mi, runs in `kube-system`. It emits a ServiceMonitor for its own `/metrics`, which
the VM operator's converter picks up like every other leaf.

### `--kubelet-insecure-tls`
metrics-server verifies the kubelet serving cert by default. On Talos that cert is self-signed, so
verification fails. We set `--kubelet-insecure-tls` (skip cert-identity verification; the connection stays
TLS-encrypted). `--kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP` is kept (chart default; the kubelet
serving-cert SANs are node IPs and Talos hostnames aren't in DNS). `--kubelet-certificate-authority` is
rejected for now — it only works if the kubelet cert is CA-signed, which Talos doesn't do by default.

The security gain of the secure path is marginal here: it's a pod→kubelet hop on the cluster's own trusted,
NIC-hardened L2 (see [03_operating_system.md](03_operating_system.md)), and the connection is encrypted
either way — only the cert identity goes unchecked. So we take the one-flag, zero-OS-change route.

> **Secure-path upgrade (stays open):** to drop `--kubelet-insecure-tls`, add
> `rotate-server-certificates: true` to 03d's `cp-patch.yaml` (re-applied to all three nodes), add a
> CSR-approver platform app (Kubernetes never auto-approves `kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving` CSRs; the
> Talos-documented `alex1989hu/...` ships raw kustomize, breaking the wrapper-chart convention, so the
> Helm-native `postfinance/kubelet-csr-approver` with SAN/IP-regex config is the fit), then swap the flag
> for `--kubelet-certificate-authority=/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt`.

### Verify
```bash
export KUBECONFIG=secrets/kubeconfig
kubectl get apiservice v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io    # AVAILABLE: True
kubectl top nodes                                # the real end-to-end check
kubectl top pods -A
```
A TLS error from `kubectl top` despite `--kubelet-insecure-tls` is the signal to move to the secure path,
not to debug the flag.

## Rightsizing (KRR)

Two halves to catching over-/undersized containers, and the stack already provides one: **continuous
visualization** is the Grafana `k8s_views_pods` dashboard (usage vs requests, always on). What it doesn't give
is a concrete number to set. [KRR](https://github.com/robusta-dev/krr) (Robusta Kubernetes Resource
Recommender) fills that gap: it reads usage history from the metrics store and prints, per workload, the
current request next to a recommended one for CPU and memory. Run it on demand: `make krr` (table),
`make krr-json`, or `make krr-yaml`. The script passes `"$@"` straight to KRR, so for any other flag (e.g.
`-n <ns>` to scope) run it directly: `bash lib/shell/krr.sh -n <ns>`. It runs our custom **`conservative`**
strategy by default (see below); the upstream `simple`/`simple-limit` still work
(`bash lib/shell/krr.sh` with `KRR_STRATEGY` edited, or `--help` on either).

### Why on-demand, not automated
At 3-node homelab scale — a handful of workloads, one operator — a weekly in-cluster CronJob + a report store
+ a dedicated Robusta UI is overkill. `make krr` is the right-sized answer: run it when you want to retune,
read the table, hand-edit the relevant chart `values.yaml`. It matches the repo's existing tooling
conventions — KRR runs **dockerized** (like `talosctl()`), reaching the metrics store over the same
documented break-glass port-forward (`kubectl -n monitoring port-forward svc/vmsingle-... 8428:8428`) that
`05_victoria_metrics_k8s_stack` already advertises, and the kube API via the 03d kubeconfig. Reuses
`MONITORING_NS`; adds no cluster workload, no ArgoCD app, no SSO host.

### The `conservative` strategy (custom, RAM-frugal)
`lib/krr/conservative.py` is a custom KRR strategy for this cluster's scarce RAM (3x 8GB). The built-in
`simple` sets memory `request == limit == peak + buffer`; but `request` is what the scheduler **reserves**, so
requesting the peak permanently books rarely-used memory and tanks pod density. `conservative` splits them:

- **memory request = max(average working-set, 16Mi)** — scheduler packs on typical use, not peak; the 16Mi
  floor (`--memory-request-min`) reflects the idle working set so the scheduler doesn't overcommit,
- **memory limit = max(peak × 1.2, 32Mi)** (`--memory_limit_buffer_percentage` + `--memory-limit-min`), raised
  further to the **OOMKilled limit + 25%** for any workload OOMKilled during the window (`--use-oomkill-data`,
  on by default — an OOMKill proves the ceiling was too low; the bump lands on the limit, not the request),
- **CPU unchanged** from `simple` (request = 95th percentile, no limit — CPU is compressible).

The two memory floors are **asymmetric** (request 16Mi < limit 32Mi), which KRR's single `--mem-min` can't
express — it floors request and limit to the *same* value. So the floors live inside the strategy
(`lib/krr/conservative.py`) and `krr.sh` runs with `--mem-min 0` to hand floor control to it. Rationale for
splitting them: the *request* floor is a scheduling concern (reserve ~the idle footprint; too low → node
overcommit + eviction-prone), while the *limit* floor is the OOM-safety headroom (cold-start/GC spikes) — a
low request never OOM-kills a pod, only the limit does. Both are knobs at the top of `krr.sh`
(`KRR_REQ_MIN`, `KRR_LIM_MIN`).

Deliberate trade-off: since requests no longer cover the peak, simultaneous peaks across pods can exhaust node
RAM and trigger a kernel/node-pressure OOMKill even while each pod is under its own limit. That's the price of
the density; keep a node eviction headroom and watch for OOMKills.

It loads without rebuilding the image: `lib/shell/krr.sh` bind-mounts `conservative.py` into the image's
`robusta_krr/strategies/` package plus a shadow `__init__.py` (`lib/krr/strategies_init.py`) that imports it,
so KRR's `__subclasses__()` discovery registers it. Written against KRR **v1.28.0** internals — revisit both
files on an image bump.

### Metrics dependency
`conservative` reads `container_cpu_usage_seconds_total` and `container_memory_working_set_bytes` (the latter
via both `max_over_time` and `avg_over_time`), plus — for the OOMKill floor — `kube_pod_container_resource_limits`
and `kube_pod_container_status_last_terminated_reason`. All four are **kept** by vmagent's `metricRelabelConfigs`
drop list (the drops are otherwise aggressive), so `--use-oomkill-data` has data on this cluster. VictoriaMetrics
speaks the Prometheus query API, so the queries run unchanged. If a future drop-list change removes the OOM
series the flag degrades gracefully (that loader has `warning_on_no_data = False`), just stops bumping limits.

### Docker networking note
The script runs KRR on the **default bridge network** (not `--network host`) pointing at
`http://host.docker.internal:<port>`: on Docker Desktop/macOS a host-network container can't see the
host-side port-forward, whereas the bridge reaches it via `host.docker.internal`; the kube API VIP is a LAN
IP reachable from the bridge via NAT.

### Verify
```bash
make krr    # prints a KRR table: workload | cpu request->recommended | mem request->recommended
# Expect no "metric not found" / connection-refused errors. Spot-check one row against the
# k8s_views_pods Grafana dashboard — measured usage should sit near KRR's recommended request.
```
