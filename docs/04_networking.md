# Networking: Cilium

The cluster from [step 03](03_operating_system.md) comes up with no CNI (`cni: none`) and no kube-proxy
(`proxy.disabled: true`), both set in [bring-up](03_operating_system.md#cluster-bring-up). Cilium fills all of it
from one install: CNI, load balancer, and node-to-node encryption. `04_cilium.sh` does it and flips the nodes to
Ready.

- The one component installed imperatively. Everything after it is GitOps.
- Nothing has a pod network until it lands, so ArgoCD, CoreDNS and every workload depend on it.
- Source of truth is the wrapper chart at `argo_apps/platform/charts/00_cilium/`. The script only installs that
  chart; ArgoCD later adopts the same release (same chart, namespace, release name, values) so Argo sees it
  in-sync rather than fighting it. No version, CRD list or value lives in the script.

## Why Cilium: one component instead of three

Bare-metal Kubernetes ships no LoadBalancer, no ingress and no encryption. The alternative is stacking three
single-purpose tools. Cilium does all of it from one agent plus operator.

| Need              | Cilium provides                  | What it replaces, and why |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| LoadBalancer IPs  | LB-IPAM + L2 announcements (ARP) | MetalLB. On an all-Cilium cluster it only duplicates the IP-announce half (eBPF already does the data-path LB), adds a second ARP owner on the same nodes, and adds pods plus CRDs for no gain. Trade-off: Cilium L2 is Beta vs MetalLB's GA L2, fine for a homelab. |
| Ingress / gateway | Gateway API (Envoy-backed)       | ingress-nginx, which the community retires in March 2026. Gateway API is the forward path. Cilium can serve it, but ingress went to Envoy Gateway for its `SecurityPolicy` CRD (label-attached SSO), so Cilium's `gatewayAPI` is off and it vendors no Gateway API CRDs. See [07_ingress.md](07_ingress.md) |
| Pod encryption    | transparent WireGuard, one flag  | Istio or another service mesh. We wanted the wire encrypted plus a gateway, not AuthorizationPolicy or VirtualService. Sidecar Istio is also heavy on 3x 8 GB Pis, one Envoy per pod |
| A mesh, if needed | sidecarless L7 + Hubble          | covers what we would use a mesh for, without per-pod sidecars |

Decisions:

- WireGuard, not mTLS. Transparent, node-to-node, no certs or SPIFFE. Exactly "encrypt the wire". Same-node pod
  traffic is NOT encrypted, since it never leaves the host. Cilium's SPIFFE mutual-auth is a separate feature we
  do not enable. The image kernel already carries `CONFIG_WIREGUARD`.
- kube-proxy replacement is mandatory: L2 announcements require it. Hence `proxy.disabled: true` at the Talos
  layer and `kubeProxyReplacement: true` in the values.
- KubePrism (`localhost:7445`) is Cilium's API endpoint. Pure host networking, so Cilium needs no external LB to
  reach the API server.

## What `04_cilium.sh` does

Native `helm` + `kubectl`, erroring out if either is missing, unlike the dockerized 03a-03e scripts. Talks to the
cluster via `secrets/kubeconfig` (written by 03d). Idempotent.

1. `helm dependency build argo_apps/platform/charts/00_cilium` pulls the pinned `cilium/cilium` subchart into
   `charts/`, falling back to `helm dependency update` to generate `Chart.lock` on a first run.
2. `helm upgrade --install cilium ... --wait` installs with the chart's values: KubePrism endpoint, kube-proxy
   replacement, WireGuard, L2 announcements, Hubble, and the Talos-mandatory `cgroup` (no auto-mount) plus
   `securityContext` capability blocks.
3. Waits for nodes Ready. They were NotReady with no CNI.
4. Enables the LB-IPAM pool + L2 policy. See the two-pass note below.
5. Verifies agent and operator rollout, and the LB pool.

The two-pass install exists because the `CiliumLoadBalancerIPPool` and L2 CRDs are registered by the
cilium-operator at RUNTIME, not shipped by the chart. On a fresh cluster they do not exist when Helm would apply
the pool, so step 2 runs with `--set loadBalancer.enabled=false`, then the upgrade re-runs with the gate back on
once the operator is up. On a re-run the CRD is already there and it happens in one shot. ArgoCD just leaves
`loadBalancer.enabled=true` and relies on sync-retry.

```bash
./04_cilium.sh
```

Smoke-test the LoadBalancer end to end:

```bash
kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx
kubectl expose deploy nginx --type=LoadBalancer --port=80
kubectl get svc nginx              # EXTERNAL-IP from your pool, reachable over ARP
```

## Hubble observability

`hubble.enabled`, `relay` and `ui` are all true, so `hubble-relay` and `hubble-ui` run in `kube-system`. Two ways
it surfaces:

- Metrics and dashboards. `hubble.metrics` exports a lean flow set (`dns, drop, tcp, flow, icmp,
  port-distribution`, kept small to bound the number of series on the Pis) with a `serviceMonitor`, so it reaches
  vmagent like every other platform scrape. `hubble.metrics.dashboards.enabled: true` makes the chart emit its
  official Hubble dashboards as `grafana_dashboard`-labelled ConfigMaps into `kube-system`, and Grafana's sidecar
  (`searchNamespace: ALL`) imports them with no extra wiring. The same `cilium_*` metrics drive the
  `cilium-health` Grafana alert group: agent-down, BPF-map pressure, unreachable nodes. See
  [09_monitoring.md](09_monitoring.md).
- UI. The `hubble-ui` Service is exposed as `hubble.<domain>` by the platform-ingress app (wave 6) and gated by
  Google SSO: a plain cross-namespace edge into `kube-system`, in the same `hosts` list and `04_google_sso`
  allowlist as the other platform UIs. See [07_ingress.md](07_ingress.md).

## Network policy

Lockdown is opt-in per component via `CiliumNetworkPolicy`. There is no cluster-wide default-deny. CNP over
vanilla `NetworkPolicy` buys the `kube-apiserver` and `world` entities, so no hardcoded IPs, plus Hubble
policy-verdict visibility (`hubble observe --verdict DROPPED`).

Two places carry policies. Workloads: the sample workload's app plus its CNPG Postgres, see
[10_sample_workload.md](10_sample_workload.md) for those and for the reusable DB policy baked into the
`pg-cluster` wrapper. Platform: a full explicit policy per chart in its own `templates/networkpolicy.yaml`, so
the file you open is the policy that gets applied, with no shared library or render abstraction. Three groups:

- Secret-holders, namespace-wide default-deny (`endpointSelector: {}`): `sealed-secrets`, `cert-manager`,
  `argocd`.
- Data stores and services, pod-scoped because their namespace also holds an unrestricted scraper: `vmsingle`,
  `vlsingle`, `grafana` (`vmagent` shares `monitoring` and scrapes the whole cluster, so it stays unrestricted),
  `ntfy`, the RabbitMQ broker, and the egress-only backup CronJobs `redis-backup` and `vm-backup`.
- Operators and the backup plugin, pod-scoped, added so no pod-running component is left implicitly
  default-allow: `cnpg-operator`, `redis-operator`, the RabbitMQ `cluster-operator` and
  `messaging-topology-operator`, and the `barman-cloud` CNPG-I plugin (the S3 backup coordinator, which holds the
  S3 client mTLS identity). Each allows only its real surface: the metrics scrape where a PodMonitor exists, the
  admission webhook where enabled, the kubelet health probe, DNS, the API server, and egress to the specific pods
  it manages.

External egress (argocd to GitHub, cert-manager to ACME, grafana to a plugin download, barman to S3) is
`toEntities: [world]` on the specific port rather than `toFQDNs`, so there is no DNS-proxy dependency. Peer
selectors (CoreDNS `k8s-app: kube-dns`, vmagent, the Envoy edge, the stores) are repeated verbatim across the
manifests, so if a platform component is relabelled you grep and update each one.

Two Cilium subtleties to know:

- A `fromEndpoints`/`toEndpoints` selector that OMITS the namespace label matches the policy's OWN namespace
  only. To reach a managed pod in another namespace (cnpg-operator to its instances, redis-operator to its
  redises) use `matchExpressions: [{key: k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace, operator: Exists}]`, NOT the empty `{}`
  selector, which is also same-namespace.
- The RabbitMQ operator subchart ships bundled vanilla `NetworkPolicy`s that default to allow-all-egress. Cilium
  UNIONs those with our CNP and would blow the default-deny open, so we pin `...networkPolicy.enabled: false`.
  Same move as argocd's `global.networkPolicy.create: false`. See [05_gitops.md](05_gitops.md) and
  [11_messaging.md](11_messaging.md).

Deliberately NOT policed, listed so it reads as a decision rather than an omission:

- The Envoy data plane (`mergeGateways` means egress fans out to every backend) and its Gateway controller (same
  namespace, on the ingress critical path).
- `vmagent` and the VictoriaLogs collector, which scrape everything.
- `metrics-server` and `nic-keeper`, which are kube-system or host-network.
- `longhorn`, which runs a node-to-node replication mesh.
- `vm-operator` and `local-path-provisioner`, tiny apiserver-only surfaces.
- `03_gateway` and `google-sso`, which have no or thin pods.
- `kube-system` and Cilium itself. Policing those risks cutting the cluster off its own network.
- The `storage-bench` namespace, which exists for hours at a time and holds no data. See
  [16_storage_bench.md](16_storage_bench.md).

Rollout is audit-first: with Cilium's global `policyAuditMode` on, every policy stages as log-only (`hubble
observe --verdict AUDIT`) until validated, then gets enforced by turning audit off.

## Caveats

- Run order: 03e before 04. Harden the NIC ahead of Cilium's network-heavy rollout. The script's only
  cluster-side dependency is a reachable API, which works over the VIP even with no CNI.
- All nodes are control-plane, so the L2 policy selects every Linux node. The `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:
  DoesNotExist` selector from upstream examples would match zero nodes here and nothing would answer ARP.
  `cilium-lb.yaml` gets this right; do not copy the example blindly.
- CRD apiVersion split: `CiliumLoadBalancerIPPool` is `cilium.io/v2`, `CiliumL2AnnouncementPolicy` is still
  `cilium.io/v2alpha1`. Easy to get wrong by hand.
- L2 announcements is Beta and leans on leader-election leases. If you grow the pool and see operator API
  throttling, raise `k8sClientRateLimit`.
- LB pool placement must sit outside the router's DHCP lease range and clear of the VIP, or you get IP conflicts.
- Circular dependency once Argo owns it: ArgoCD runs on Cilium's network, so a bad Cilium change synced through
  Argo can cut Argo off. Upgrades are normally non-disruptive (per-node agent restart, the eBPF datapath
  persists). The Cilium Application auto-syncs with full `selfHeal` + `prune`, chosen for convenience, so
  upgrades are hands-off but Argo WILL revert an out-of-band fix and WILL cascade-delete a resource or CRD
  dropped from the chart. Keep `04_cilium.sh` as break-glass, and after using it commit the fix to git FAST,
  before `selfHeal` reverts it. A bad change pushed to git applies unattended and is self-healed in place, so
  mind your pushes: this is the one app that can take the whole cluster down. See
  [05_gitops.md](05_gitops.md).

## Troubleshooting

- Nodes stay NotReady after `04_cilium.sh`: the agents are not Ready. `kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l
  k8s-app=cilium`, then `kubectl -n kube-system logs ds/cilium`. Usual causes are the Talos
  `cgroup`/`securityContext` values missing or wrong, or KubePrism unreachable, in which case check that
  `proxy.disabled` and `kubePrism` landed in the machine config.
- `type: LoadBalancer` stuck `<pending>`: no pool, or it is exhausted or overlapping. `kubectl get
  ciliumloadbalancerippool`, and confirm the range is outside the DHCP lease and clear of the VIP.
- LB IP assigned but unreachable: L2 is not announcing. Confirm the policy's `nodeSelector` is not
  `control-plane: DoesNotExist`, which selects zero nodes here, and that the `interfaces` regex matches `end0`.
  `kubectl get ciliuml2announcementpolicy`.
- Gateway not programmed: that is Envoy Gateway now, not Cilium, whose `gatewayAPI` is disabled. The Gateway API
  CRDs and the `eg` GatewayClass come from the `01_envoy_gateway` app. See [07_ingress.md](07_ingress.md).
