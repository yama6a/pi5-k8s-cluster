# 13: Off-cluster backups — CNPG Postgres to S3

Until now durability was entirely **in-cluster**: Postgres replication across 2 instances + `local-path`
`reclaimPolicy: Retain` ([08_storage.md](08_storage.md)). That survives a node loss, but not a bad `DROP`,
data corruption, losing >1 node, or a full rebuild. This step adds the **off-cluster** tier: continuous WAL
archiving + daily base backups from every CloudNativePG cluster to **S3**, via the current
**Barman Cloud CNPG-I plugin** — giving point-in-time recovery and a ~180-day recovery window.

The S3 bucket is created by **Terraform** (the repo's only Terraform) and is deliberately general-purpose:
CNPG backups land under `cnpg/` today; `longhorn/` and `redis/` prefixes are reserved for later consumers.

Pieces (Terraform is out-of-cluster; the plugin is platform; backups are configured per-cluster via the shared chart):

| Piece                   | Where                                                              | What                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## The mental model: WAL + base, not a snapshot

A physical Postgres backup is **two things that must both work**:

1. **Continuous WAL archiving** — every 16 MB WAL segment shipped to S3 as it's completed. This is what gives
   PITR and near-zero RPO, and it's the part that's easy to under-think.
2. **Base backups** — periodic full copies of the data dir (here: daily, from a standby).

Base backup + the WAL since it = restore to any point in between. **A stalled archiver is a liveness risk,
not just a DR gap**: if WAL can't ship, `pg_wal` fills the volume and the primary goes read-only / crashes.
That's why the WAL-archive alert below is `critical`.

## Decisions (and the why)

- **Barman Cloud *plugin*, not the in-tree integration.** CNPG deprecated the in-tree `barmanObjectStore` in
  1.26 in favour of the CNPG-I plugin. We run CNPG 1.29.x, so we build on the plugin. This forced the
  `cnpg/cluster` chart bump **0.7.0 → 0.8.0** (0.7.0 only rendered the deprecated path; 0.8.0 renders the
  plugin `ObjectStore` + auto-adds `.spec.plugins` + the `ScheduledBackup`).
- **ARM64.** Both the CNPG operand images and the plugin **sidecar** image
  (`ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/plugin-barman-cloud-sidecar`) ship multi-arch manifests incl. `linux/arm64` — they
  run on the Pi 5s (the usual Pi gate, cf. the Redis exporter in [12_redis.md](12_redis.md)).
- **RPO 15 min.** `archive_timeout: "15min"` (pg-cluster values, from `.env CNPG_BACKUP_RPO`) forces a WAL
  segment switch — and thus an archive — at most every 15 min, so a primary failure loses ≤15 min of writes.
  It only *binds* in the low-but-nonzero write regime (a busy DB fills segments and archives faster; a truly
  idle DB writes no WAL and archives nothing, correctly). RPO down = more, smaller WAL objects.
- **Daily base backup, from a standby.** `ScheduledBackup` at 02:00. No `target` is set, because CNPG's
  default is already `prefer-standby` (runs on the most up-to-date replica, falling back to the primary) —
  exactly what we want, so the base-backup IO stays off the primary.
- **Storage class: land in Standard → Glacier IR @30d → expire @180d.** Objects are written as S3 **Standard**
  (Barman doesn't set a storage class). We deliberately do **not** use Standard-IA: lifecycle can't transition
  to IA before 30d anyway, and IA's 128 KB min-billable-size + per-GB retrieval fees punish the churny, often
  tiny (compressed near-empty) WAL objects. Straight to Glacier Instant Retrieval at 30d instead. `30`/`180`
  are `.env`-configurable (`S3_BACKUP_TRANSITION_DAYS` / `S3_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`). Note the interplay with
  Glacier's 90-day minimum-storage-duration: 30d→180d means objects spend 150d in Glacier IR, well past the
  minimum, so no early-delete penalty.
- **Retention: Barman's window aligned to the S3 lifecycle.** The `ObjectStore` CRD requires a non-empty
  duration (`^[1-9][0-9]*[dwm]$`) and the chart always emits the field, so leaving it unset isn't possible —
  an empty value renders as `null` and the API rejects it. Instead we set `retentionPolicy` **equal** to the S3
  expiry (`S3_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`d, default `180d`): Barman prunes its own catalog coherently at that age
  (whole backup sets + their WAL), and the S3 lifecycle expiry at the same age is the backstop. Keeping the two
  equal avoids the failure mode where one deletes objects the other still references. (Glacier's 90-day minimum
  is still satisfied — objects transition at 30d and live to 180d.)
- **Encryption:** bucket SSE with AWS-managed keys (SSE-S3 / AES256); Barman also requests AES256 on upload, so
  the two agree. No SSE-KMS to manage.
- **Credentials: Terraform makes a scoped IAM user; `.env` holds only the deployer creds.** Terraform provisions
  a dedicated, bucket-scoped IAM writer and exposes its access key as an output; `14_cnpg_backup.sh` reads that
  output and seals it into the cluster. The powerful deployer creds that run Terraform never enter the cluster.
  On bare-metal Talos there's no instance role, so it's static keys — sealed, never in `.env` or git.
- **One bucket, per-cluster prefix.** `destinationPath: s3://<bucket>/cnpg/`; Barman appends each cluster's
  `serverName` (= its `fullnameOverride`, unique per DB here), so clusters land in their own
  `cnpg/<clusterName>/{wals,base}/` — no collisions, one shared bucket + one sealed creds Secret per namespace.

## Terraform (`terraform/`)

State is **local** and gitignored (it holds the generated IAM secret key; the repo is public);
`.terraform.lock.hcl` **is** committed (provider pin, not sensitive). No `.tfvars` — the wrapper script passes
everything via `TF_VAR_*` + the `AWS_*` provider env, so no secret file lands on disk.

```sh
make s3-backup-bucket     # 13 apply  : create/update the bucket + lifecycle + IAM writer (idempotent)
make s3-backup-wipe       # 13 wipe   : delete ALL backups, KEEP the bucket + IAM (what a rebuild does)
make s3-backup-destroy    # 13 destroy: empty the bucket THEN terraform-destroy it + the IAM writer
```

The bucket is `force_destroy = false`, so a bare `terraform destroy` refuses a non-empty bucket — that's why
`destroy` empties it first (an explicit, typed-confirmed act) and nothing deletes backups by accident.

### The deployer IAM credentials (`.env`)

`.env`'s `AWS_DEPLOY_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_DEPLOY_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` are a **deployer** identity used
ONLY by Terraform + the wipe/destroy CLI — never sealed into the cluster. It needs to manage exactly one bucket
and one IAM user. Create an IAM user, attach the policy below (replace `<BUCKET>` with your `S3_BACKUP_BUCKET`
and `<ACCOUNT_ID>` with your 12-digit AWS account id — the writer user is named `<BUCKET>-writer` to match
`terraform/main.tf`), and put its access key in `.env`:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "ManageBackupBucket",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::pontiki-backups",
        "arn:aws:s3:::pontiki-backups/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "ManageBackupWriterUser",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:CreateUser",
        "iam:DeleteUser",
        "iam:GetUser",
        "iam:TagUser",
        "iam:UntagUser",
        "iam:ListUserTags",
        "iam:CreateAccessKey",
        "iam:DeleteAccessKey",
        "iam:ListAccessKeys",
        "iam:GetAccessKeyLastUsed",
        "iam:PutUserPolicy",
        "iam:DeleteUserPolicy",
        "iam:GetUserPolicy",
        "iam:ListUserPolicies",
        "iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::439889144185:user/pontiki-backups-writer"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "ProviderIdentity",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

`s3:*` is scoped to the single bucket (not account-wide): the broad verb keeps Terraform's ~20 bucket
sub-resource reads on refresh from tripping over one missing `s3:GetBucket*`/`s3:PutBucket*` — tighten to
explicit actions if you prefer. The IAM statement is scoped to the one writer user Terraform creates. The
**writer** identity Terraform then provisions (and 14 seals into the cluster) is far narrower — just
`s3:ListBucket` + `GetObject`/`PutObject`/`DeleteObject` on the bucket (see `terraform/main.tf`).

## The plugin (`03_barman_cloud_plugin`, wave 3)

The plugin ships **no Helm chart** (manifest/Kustomize only), so — unlike every other app — the wrapper vendors
the **pinned release manifest verbatim** into `templates/` (it has no Go-template braces, so Helm passes it
through); there's no dependency to pin, no `Chart.lock`, no vendored `.tgz`. The version lives in the chart's
`appVersion` + the image tag; re-vendor via that chart's `README.md`. **Wave 3** because it needs cert-manager
(wave 2, for its mTLS Issuer/Certs) and the CNPG operator (wave 2, to discover the plugin Service), and must
live in `cnpg-system`.

## Turning backups on

```sh
# .env: set the deployer creds + bucket. Empty AWS_DEPLOY_ACCESS_KEY_ID => backups stay OFF (13/14 no-op).
#   AWS_REGION, S3_BACKUP_BUCKET, AWS_DEPLOY_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_DEPLOY_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET
make s3-backup-bucket        # 13: Terraform -> bucket + lifecycle + IAM writer
make configure-cnpg-backup   # 14: yq bucket/region/RPO into pg-cluster values + seal writer creds per namespace
git add -A && git commit && git push   # ArgoCD applies the plugin + each ObjectStore/ScheduledBackup + sealed creds
```

`14` edits the **shared** `lib/helm/pg-cluster/values.yaml` (`backups.enabled: true`, `s3.bucket`, `s3.region`,
`archive_timeout`), so **every** CNPG cluster in every workload gets backups. Each Postgres-backed namespace
needs the sealed `cnpg-backup-s3` Secret (keys `ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `ACCESS_SECRET_KEY`); the list of namespaces to
seal into is `CNPG_BACKUP_TARGETS` in `14_cnpg_backup.sh` — **add a line there when you add a Postgres workload.**

`13`/`14` are wired best-effort into `DANGEROUS_bootstrap_cluster.sh` (guarded on the deployer key), so a full
bootstrap runs `terraform apply` + seals automatically. **Rebuild** runs `13 wipe` — it discards the old
backups (keeping the bucket + IAM) so the fresh clusters start a clean history; it does NOT re-seal (the
restored key already decrypts the committed secret) and does NOT `terraform destroy`. Only **`make
reset-cluster`** tears the bucket down (empty + `terraform destroy`). See the two orchestrators' headers.

## Monitoring (alerts)

`lib/helm/pg-cluster/templates/backup-alerts.yaml` adds a `PrometheusRule` (converted to a VMRule by the VM
operator) when backups are on — the upstream CNPG rules cover HA/replication/disk but nothing for backups:

- **`CNPGWALArchiveFailing`** (`critical`): `cnpg_collector_pg_wal_archive_status{value="ready"} > 0` for 15 min —
  WAL segments piling up unarchived. This is the load-bearing one (a stalled archiver fills `pg_wal`).
- **`CNPGBackupTooOld`** (`warning`): last successful base backup >36h old. Guarded with `> 0` because the
  `cnpg_collector_last_available_backup_timestamp` metric is deprecated since 1.26 and **may stay 0 under the
  plugin** — if so, this alert simply won't fire and we lean on the WAL alert + `kubectl cnpg status`.

*Verify the exact metric/label (`value` vs `status`) and whether the backup-timestamp metric populates against
the live cluster — see the verify steps below.*

## The two recovery tiers

| When                                                                | Use                                             | How                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Cluster CR deleted, **local PV survived**                           | `recover_cnpg_from_pv.sh`                       | reattach the retained `local-path` PV (fast, no S3). |
| Data **genuinely gone** — disk/node loss, corruption, PITR         | `recover_cnpg_from_s3.sh` (`make restore-cnpg`) | bootstrap a NEW cluster from the object store.       |

### Restore from S3

```sh
make restore-cnpg    # interactive: pick namespace + source cluster + target (latest | "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+ZZ")
# or non-interactive:
bash lib/shell/recover_cnpg_from_s3.sh --namespace sample-user-manager --source sample-user-manager-db \
     --target "2026-07-13 14:30:00+00" --name sample-user-manager-db-restore --apply
```

It's **non-destructive**: it creates a new single-instance `Cluster` in the source namespace that bootstraps
`bootstrap.recovery` from the existing `ObjectStore` (read-only pull via `externalClusters[].plugin`), leaving
the source backups and any live cluster untouched, and refuses to overwrite an existing cluster name. The
recovery cluster does **not** re-archive (it's a restore/verify target). When Healthy, its data is served at
`<name>-rw.<ns>` — repoint your app or dump/reload into the real cluster, then delete the recovery cluster.

**Prerequisites the script preflight-checks:** the `ObjectStore` `<source>-backups` must exist in the target
namespace, the S3-creds Secret it references must be present (seal it with `14_cnpg_backup.sh` if restoring
into a namespace that never had backups), and there must be a **completed base backup** — WAL alone has no
recovery point. It warns if the source cluster shows no `firstRecoverabilityPoint`. **Limitation:** the
recovery cluster uses the default `postgresql` operand image; a `postgis`/`timescaledb` source would need a
matching `spec.imageName` (not wired — all clusters here are `postgresql`).

### Rebuild vs reset (and why rebuild wipes the backups)

A **rebuild** (`DANGEROUS_rebuild_cluster.sh`) is a deliberate FULL fresh start: it wipes local-path **and**
empties the S3 bucket (`13 wipe`, keeping the bucket + IAM). Wiping the backups is not incidental — it's
required for correctness. The rebuilt, same-named clusters would otherwise inherit the old backup path, and
Barman refuses to mix a new Postgres systemID into an existing server's data (it would `CNPGWALArchiveFailing`
forever). Emptying the bucket lets the fresh clusters start a clean backup history.

**So a rebuild DISCARDS your backups.** If you want the old data, restore it BEFORE rebuilding — or don't
rebuild. To recover specific data without a rebuild, use `make restore-cnpg` against the live bucket.

A **reset** (`make reset-cluster`) goes further: it empties the bucket **and** `terraform destroy`s it + the
IAM writer — the full teardown. (A rebuild calls reset internally with `REBUILD_IN_PROGRESS=1`, which skips
that destroy so the bucket survives the rebuild.)

## Verify (end-to-end)

1. **Bucket:** `aws s3api get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket <bucket>` shows the GLACIER_IR@30 /
   expire@180 rule; SSE on; public access blocked; IAM writer scoped to the bucket. `make s3-backup-bucket`
   again is a no-op.
2. **Plugin synced:** platform Healthy; `kubectl get crd objectstores.barmancloud.cnpg.io`; the `barman-cloud`
   Deployment Ready in `cnpg-system`.
3. **WAL archiving live** (load-bearing): `kubectl cnpg status <cluster> -n <ns>` → "Continuous Archiving: OK"
    + a first-recoverability point; objects under `s3://<bucket>/cnpg/<cluster>/wals/`. The daily base backup
      runs on the **standby** pod.
4. **RPO:** `SELECT pg_switch_wal();` on the primary → a new object in `…/wals/` within seconds; confirm
   `SHOW archive_timeout;` is `15min`.
5. **Restore drill:** `make restore-cnpg` → target `latest` into a throwaway name → it reaches Healthy from S3
   and serves data. Repeat with a PITR `targetTime`.
6. **Alerts:** confirm the metric name/label against `/metrics`; break archiving (e.g. revoke the IAM key
   briefly) → `CNPGWALArchiveFailing` fires; restore → it clears.

## One ArgoCD wrinkle to watch

The `cnpg/cluster` chart annotates the `ObjectStore` as a Helm `pre-install,pre-upgrade` hook, which ArgoCD
treats as a **PreSync** hook (default delete-policy `BeforeHookCreation`) — so on each sync ArgoCD may
delete+recreate the ObjectStore. Syncs are occasional (git change / drift), and recreation is immediate, so the
window is tiny; watch for archive blips around syncs and, if it ever matters, render a plain ObjectStore instead.
