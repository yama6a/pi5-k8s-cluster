# GitOps — ArgoCD

The cluster from [step 03](03_operating_system.md) is networked by [step 04](04_networking.md) (**Cilium**). **ArgoCD**
is the next and **last component installed imperatively** — from here on, everything is GitOps. ArgoCD **manages
itself** from a wrapper chart in this repo, **adopts** the already-running Cilium, and becomes the delivery path for
every later app (the [`nic-keeper` recovery DaemonSet](06_nic_keeper.md), etcd snapshots, monitoring, Longhorn, workloads). **`05_argocd.sh`**
does the one-time bootstrap.

The **single source of truth** is the wrapper Helm chart at `argo_apps/charts/01_argocd/`. `05_argocd.sh` just installs
that chart by hand, then hands off to git: ArgoCD adopts the same release (same chart, namespace, release name, values →
Argo sees it in-sync rather than fighting it) and self-manages from then on. Nothing — no version, no values — is defined
in the script. The chart:

| Path                 | Holds                                                                                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Chart.yaml`         | the **argo-cd chart version** (`9.6.0`, ArgoCD `v3.4.4`), declared as a dependency on argo-helm. |
| `values.yaml`        | the **HA-lite values** (under the `argo-cd:` key) — see below.                                  |
| `Chart.lock`         | pins the resolved dependency; **must be committed** (ArgoCD's repo-server needs it — see below). |

## The `argo_apps/` app-of-apps model

```
argo_apps/
  root-app.yaml          # the app-of-apps ROOT (applied once by 05_argocd.sh)
  apps/                  # root watches this dir (directory.recurse) — one Application per app
    00_cilium.yaml       #   adopts Cilium      (auto-sync, no selfHeal)  — wave 0
    01_argocd.yaml       #   ArgoCD self-manage (automated)               — wave 1
  charts/                # the wrapper charts the Applications point at
    00_cilium/           #   step 04's chart
    01_argocd/           #   this step's chart
```

- **`root-app.yaml`** is an Application that recurses `argo_apps/apps/` and manages every child Application it finds.
- Each child Application points at a wrapper chart under `argo_apps/charts/`.
- **Add a new app** = drop a wrapper chart under `argo_apps/charts/NN_name/` + an Application manifest under
  `argo_apps/apps/NN_name.yaml`, then commit & push. The root picks it up on its next reconcile. (The `NN` prefix **is**
  the app's `sync-wave` number — keep the filename, the chart dir, and the annotation in agreement. See the convention
  below.)

### sync-wave convention

Ordering across apps is `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave` (lower = earlier; the root waits for a wave to be **Synced +
Healthy** before creating the next). **The `NN` prefix on each `apps/NN_*.yaml` file equals its wave number** — one
glance at the dir listing tells you the order.

- **Cilium = wave `0`.** The CNI underpins everything, so it goes first. This is only safe because the Cilium app
  **auto-syncs**: it reaches Healthy on its own, the wave clears, and the root proceeds. A *manual* app at wave 0 would
  start **OutOfSync** and stall forever, **blocking the root from ever creating the later-wave apps** (including
  `argocd`). That's the trap to avoid: **never put a manual-sync app at an earlier wave than apps that depend on it.**
- **ArgoCD = wave `1`.** Adopts the already-running, self-managed ArgoCD once the CNI is in.
- **Future** managed apps go at wave **`2`+**, so they reconcile after the platform (CNI + engine) is in place.
- **Caveat:** if you break-glass-fix Cilium out of band and *don't* commit the fix, its app sits OutOfSync at wave 0 and
  can block later waves on the next root sync. Always commit the fix back to git.

## HA-lite — sized for 3× 8 GB Pis

ArgoCD is **not** in the data path of running apps: once an app is synced it runs regardless of Argo, so a few seconds of
no reconciliation is fine. We spend the RAM only where an outage would actually hurt:

| Component                  | Setting                          | Why                                                                       |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| application-controller     | 1 replica                        | the reconciler; a singleton that **self-heals** on restart.               |
| redis                      | single (`redis-ha.enabled:false`)| only a cache — rebuilds in seconds on restart. (redis-ha = ~5 extra pods.) |
| repo-server                | **2 replicas + PDB**             | manifest generation; kept up across a node drain.                         |
| server (API/UI)            | **2 replicas + PDB**             | the UI/API; kept up across a node drain.                                  |
| applicationSet-controller  | 2 replicas                       | leader-elected; 2 for fast failover (drop to 1 if RAM gets tight).        |
| dex, notifications         | **disabled**                     | no SSO, no notifications yet — 2 fewer pods.                              |

The 2-replica components carry `global.topologySpreadConstraints` (`maxSkew 1`, `kubernetes.io/hostname`,
`DoNotSchedule`) — over 3 nodes that forces each pair onto **two distinct nodes**. Singletons satisfy it trivially.

## Decision notes

- **Git auth = anonymous by default; single-repo PAT for private repos.** The repo (`yama6a/pi5-k8s-cluster`) is
  **public**, so ArgoCD clones it anonymously over HTTPS — no secret needed. To run this project against a **private**
  repo (or to lift the anonymous git rate limit), `05_argocd.sh` seeds a read-only PAT before hand-off. See
  [Git auth](#git-auth) below for the how + why-imperative.
- **Cilium auto-syncs — but without `selfHeal`, with `prune: false`.** A deliberate compromise for the one app that can
  cut Argo (and the cluster) off its own network — the **circular dependency** called out in
  [04_networking.md](04_networking.md). Auto-sync gives hands-off upgrades; `selfHeal: false` means an out-of-band
  break-glass fix via `04_cilium.sh` is **never reverted** mid-incident; `prune: false` means a removed CRD is never
  cascade-deleted. The price: a bad Cilium change *pushed to git* applies unattended — **mind your pushes**, and after
  any break-glass **commit the fix back to git**. First sync auto-adopts the running release with no pod churn, because
  the chart's `values.yaml` already commits `loadBalancer.enabled: true`, so Argo's rendered desired state matches live.
- **`Chart.lock` must be committed** for any wrapper chart with dependencies. ArgoCD's repo-server renders charts with
  `helm dependency build`, which **requires** the lock. `00_cilium` already has one; `01_argocd`'s is generated on the
  first run of `05_argocd.sh` (`helm dependency update`) — **commit it** before the `argocd` app reconciles (the script
  reminds you).
- **UI over port-forward** for now. `server.insecure: true` serves plain HTTP, so no TLS to fumble through a port-forward.
  Cilium's LB-IPAM is live (step 04) and the Envoy Gateway ingress lands later, so a `LoadBalancer` Service or Gateway is an option later — flip
  `server.insecure` to `false` and front it with TLS when that happens.

## Git auth

This repo is **public**, so ArgoCD clones it **anonymously** over HTTPS — no credential needed by default. Anonymous
`git ls-remote` is git smart-HTTP, **not** the REST API, so the 10s poll stays well under GitHub's limits (rationale
in `argo_apps/charts/01_argocd/values.yaml`).

For a **private** repo (or to lift the anonymous rate limit), `05_argocd.sh` **seeds a credential**: at hand-off it
**prompts** for a **fine-grained, read-only, single-repo PAT** (input hidden) — leave it empty for a public repo — then
creates an ArgoCD `repository` Secret (labelled `argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: repository`, with `url` == the polled
`repoURL`) **before** it applies the root app. The prompt prints the exact PAT how-to inline.

```text
# Create the PAT first: GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Fine-grained tokens
#   Repository access: Only select repositories → this repo
#   Permissions: Repository → Contents → Read-only   (nothing else)
# Then just run the script — it asks for the token (hidden) during hand-off:
./05_gitops/05_argocd.sh
# (Automation only: pre-set GIT_TOKEN in the env to skip the prompt.)
```

**Why the credential is seeded imperatively (and not via sealed-secrets).** A private repo's clone credential **cannot
live in that repo** — ArgoCD needs it for the *first* clone (chicken-and-egg). On bare metal there's no cloud identity to
fall back on, so **exactly one secret must be seeded out-of-band at bootstrap**; the script's `kubectl apply` of the
`repository` Secret is that seed (same role as the kubeconfig). **Sealed-secrets does not remove this step** — its
controller decrypts `SealedSecret`s, but getting the repo `SealedSecret` into the cluster still needs either an ArgoCD
clone (deadlock) or a manual apply (the same out-of-band seed, with extra indirection). So the repo credential is seeded
directly, and **sealed-secrets is reserved for app/cluster secrets later** (GitOps-managed, wave 1+), optionally
mirroring the repo credential for rebuild DR. **Least privilege:** single-repo, `Contents: Read-only`; rotate by
re-running with a new token. A **GitHub App** is the upgrade path if you outgrow a PAT.

## What `05_argocd.sh` does

Uses **native `helm` + `kubectl`** (errors out if either is missing) — like `04_cilium.sh`, unlike the dockerized
talos-phase scripts (03a–03e). Talks to the cluster via `03_operating_system/talos-cluster/kubeconfig`. Idempotent.

1. **Prereqs** — `kubectl`/`helm` present, kubeconfig reachable, the chart + root app exist, and **Cilium is up** (the
   GitOps layer needs a working pod network).
2. **Vendors** the argo-cd subchart: `helm dependency build` (falls back to `helm dependency update`, which generates
   `Chart.lock` on first run — commit it).
3. `helm upgrade --install argocd argo_apps/charts/01_argocd -n argocd --create-namespace --reset-values --wait` —
   release `argocd` / namespace `argocd` so the self-managed Application adopts THIS release.
4. Waits for the controller / repo-server / server to roll out.
5. **Hands off**: resolves the repo to poll (`$REPO_URL`, else the git `origin` remote as a prompt default) and pins it
   into `root-app.yaml`; **optionally seeds a `GIT_TOKEN` repository credential** (see [Git auth](#git-auth)); then,
   after a "did you push?" check (ArgoCD reads git, not local disk), `kubectl apply` the root app. The root creates
   `cilium` (wave 0) which auto-adopts, then `argocd` (wave 1) which self-adopts — both Synced, no clicks.
6. Waits for `root` + `argocd` to be **Synced/Healthy**, then prints the admin password + port-forward command.

```bash
# 1) generate + commit the argo-cd Chart.lock (first time only), commit the new files, and PUSH:
helm dependency update argo_apps/charts/01_argocd
git add argo_apps 05_gitops 03_operating_system.md && git commit -m "step 05: ArgoCD" && git push

# 2) bootstrap:
./05_gitops/05_argocd.sh

# 3) reach the UI (user: admin; password printed by the script):
kubectl -n argocd port-forward svc/argocd-server 8080:80
#    then open http://localhost:8080 — all apps auto-adopt, nothing to click.
```

## Caveats

- **Run order: 04 before 05.** ArgoCD (and CoreDNS, and every workload) needs Cilium's pod network; the script refuses to
  run if `ds/cilium` is absent.
- **Push before you hand off.** ArgoCD clones the **public** repo — anything not committed *and pushed* is invisible to
  the root app, which then shows `ComparisonError: path does not exist`. The script prompts; re-running after pushing is
  safe (`ASSUME_PUSHED=1` skips the prompt).
- **Self-management is real.** Once the `argocd` app is Synced, changes to `argo_apps/charts/01_argocd/values.yaml` are
  applied by ArgoCD to itself on push. A bad value can disrupt ArgoCD briefly; it self-heals, and `05_argocd.sh` remains
  break-glass (re-run to force the release back to the chart).
- **The leftover Helm release secret** (`sh.helm.release.v1.argocd.*` in `argocd`) from the by-hand install is harmless;
  once the app is adopted you may delete it.

## Troubleshooting

- **`argocd` app stuck `ComparisonError` / "app path does not exist"** → the files aren't on the remote. Commit & push
  `argo_apps/**` (incl. `Chart.lock`), then re-sync.
- **`argocd` app `OutOfSync` with a `helm dependency build` error** → `Chart.lock` isn't committed (or is stale). Run
  `helm dependency update argo_apps/charts/01_argocd`, commit the lock, re-sync.
- **`cilium` app `OutOfSync`** → it auto-syncs, so this means live drift (a break-glass `04_cilium.sh` fix not yet in
  git, or `Chart.lock`/CRD issues). With `selfHeal` off Argo won't self-correct — commit the fix to git, then it reconciles.
- **`server`/`repo-server` pods pending** → the `DoNotSchedule` topology spread needs 2 schedulable nodes free; check
  `kubectl -n argocd get pods -o wide` and node pressure (Longhorn/monitoring not yet installed, so this is rare now).
- **Can't log in** → admin password:
  `kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d`.

## Reading the script output

`[PASS]`/`[FAIL]` per check, then `summary: N passed, M failed` (exit non-zero on any fail). A clean run ends with `root`
`argocd`, and `cilium` all Synced/Healthy (everything auto-adopts).
