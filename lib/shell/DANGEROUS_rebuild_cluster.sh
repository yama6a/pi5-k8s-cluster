# One-shot orchestrator: wipe the cluster and rebuild it end to end. One confirmation, up front.
#
# Sequence:
#   0. git add/commit/push             : ArgoCD deploys the REMOTE repo, not your laptop, so sync it first
#   1. DANGEROUS_reset_talos_cluster.sh: wipe STATE+EPHEMERAL+u-longhorn, reboot to maintenance
#   2. 03c_talos_cluster_config.sh     : wait for maintenance, apply config, bootstrap etcd
#   3. 03d_nic_hardening.sh            : NIC hardening
#   4. 04_cilium.sh                    : CNI + prometheus-operator CRDs + LB-IPAM/L2 + Hubble
#   5. git add/commit/push             : 04 wrote the LB range into the chart values; 05 refuses a dirty argo_apps/
#   6. 05_argocd.sh                    : bootstrap ArgoCD, which then deploys everything else from git
#   7. 06_restore_sealed_secrets_key.sh: restore the master key so committed SealedSecrets decrypt
#   8. 13_s3_backup_bucket.sh wipe     : DELETE all backups in the bucket, keeping the bucket and IAM
#   9. converge argocd apps            : settle, then drive every app to Synced+Healthy
#  10. 10_ntfy_auth.sh                 : seed ntfy users, seal Grafana's token, push, restart grafana
#  11. verify ingress serving          : wait until each HTTPS host serves an LE cert
#
# A rebuild is a FULL fresh start: it wipes local data AND the S3 backups, so the empty same-named clusters
# ArgoCD recreates begin a clean backup history with no old-vs-new systemID conflict. To keep the OLD data,
# restore BEFORE rebuilding.
# We RESTORE the sealed-secrets key rather than re-seal, so the committed backup SealedSecrets still decrypt.
#
# This script does NOT back up the key: doing it here would risk overwriting a good backup with the
# about-to-be-wiped cluster's key. Back up DELIBERATELY beforehand so step 7 has something to restore. With
# no backup, step 7 fails cleanly and you re-seal instead.
#
# Skips 03a/03b: a reset keeps BOOT/EFI/META, so the OS is already on the NVMe and 03c waits for
# maintenance itself. Steps 0-6 abort on the first failure; 7 onwards are best-effort.

This will DESTROY and REBUILD the entire Talos cluster:
  nodes : ${IPS[*]}
  wipe  : STATE + EPHEMERAL + u-longhorn  (ALL k8s state AND every Longhorn volume, gone for good)
  flow  : commit+push -> reset -> 03c -> 03d -> 04 -> commit+push -> 05 -> restore sealed-secrets key -> WIPE S3 backups -> seed ntfy
          (ArgoCD then redeploys cilium/cert-manager/longhorn/gateway/SSO/monitoring from git)
  note  : FULL fresh start, wipes the CNPG volumes AND the S3 backups. The DBs come back EMPTY. If you want
          the old data, restore from S3 BEFORE rebuilding (make restore-cnpg); a rebuild discards it.

Have a CURRENT sealed-secrets key backup (06_backup_sealed_secrets_key.sh), else SSO won't decrypt
until you re-seal (07_google_sso). ntfy alerting is seeded post-boot via 10_ntfy_auth regardless.

=============== cluster rebuilt ===============
ArgoCD is bootstrapped and reconciling every app from git (cilium adopt, cert-manager, longhorn,
envoy-gateway, gateway, SSO, monitoring). Watch it:
  KUBECONFIG=${KUBECONFIG_FILE} kubectl get applications -n argocd -w

Notes:
  - If the key restore (STEP 8) didn't run, do it once sealed-secrets is up
    (lib/shell/06_restore_sealed_secrets_key.sh), or re-seal with 07_google_sso and commit+push.
  - ntfy alerting: STEP 11 re-seeded it automatically (if NTFY_PHONE_PASSWORD_SECRET was set). The reset wiped
    ntfy's PVC, so a fresh token was minted + re-sealed. If it was skipped/failed, run 'make configure-ntfy-auth'
    + commit/push + restart grafana. On your phone, re-subscribe 'cluster-alerts' at https://ntfy.ops.pontiki.app.
  - FULL FRESH START: the wipe cleared every volume AND the S3 backups (STEP 9). The DBs come back EMPTY and
    begin a clean backup history. If you wanted the old data, you had to restore BEFORE rebuilding
    (make restore-cnpg) first, because a rebuild discards it. The bucket + IAM stay; only \`make reset-cluster\` destroys them.
    See docs/13_backups.md.
  - TLS certs re-issue via HTTP-01; first issuance takes a few minutes. If you've rebuilt repeatedly,
    validate hosts on letsencrypt-staging before flipping to prod (tight rate limits).
