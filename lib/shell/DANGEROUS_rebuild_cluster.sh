#
# One-shot orchestrator: wipe the cluster and rebuild it end-to-end so you don't run the steps by hand.
# Sequence (one confirmation, up front):
#   0. git add/commit/push             : ArgoCD deploys the REMOTE repo, not your laptop, so sync it first
#   1. DANGEROUS_reset_talos_cluster.sh, wipe STATE+EPHEMERAL+u-longhorn+u-localpath, reboot to maintenance
#   2. 03d_talos_cluster_config.sh     : WAITS for maintenance, applies config, bootstraps etcd
#   3. 03e_nic_hardening.sh            : NIC hardening (EEE/watchdog)
#   4. 04_cilium.sh                    : CNI + prometheus-operator CRDs + LB-IPAM/L2 + Hubble
#   5. 05_argocd.sh                    : bootstrap ArgoCD; it then deploys everything else from git
#   6. 06_restore_sealed_secrets_key.sh, restore the master key so committed SealedSecrets decrypt
#   7. 13_s3_backup_bucket.sh wipe     : DELETE all backups in the S3 bucket (keep the bucket/IAM; no terraform)
#   8. 10_ntfy_auth.sh                 : seed ntfy users + seal Grafana's token, push + restart grafana (skipped if .env pw empty)
#   9. verify ingress serving          : wait until each HTTPS host serves an LE cert over clean HTTP/2
#
# A rebuild is a FULL fresh start: it wipes local CNPG data AND the S3 backups (step 7), so the empty,
# same-named clusters ArgoCD recreates begin a CLEAN backup history (no old-vs-new systemID conflict). The
# bucket + IAM stay (no terraform destroy — that's `make reset-cluster`). We RESTORE the sealed-secrets key
# (step 6) rather than re-seal, so the committed CNPG-backup SealedSecret still decrypts — no 14_cnpg_backup
# re-seal needed. If you want the OLD data back, restore BEFORE rebuilding — a rebuild discards it.
#
# Skips 03a/03b/03c (image build/flash/boot-verify): a reset keeps BOOT/EFI/META, so the OS is already on
# the NVMe, no reflash. 03d waits for maintenance itself. Bootstrap steps (1-5) abort on the first
# failure; the git + restore + bucket steps (0,6,7) are best-effort with printed fallbacks so a slow ArgoCD
# never wedges the rebuild.
#
# This script does NOT back up the sealed-secrets key, doing it here would risk overwriting a good
# backup with the about-to-be-wiped cluster's key. Back up DELIBERATELY beforehand
# (lib/shell/06_backup_sealed_secrets_key.sh) so step 6 has something to restore; with no backup,
# step 6 fails cleanly and you re-seal instead (07_google_sso) + commit/push. (ntfy's Grafana token is minted
# post-boot from the running ntfy pod via 10_ntfy_auth, regardless of the key.)
#
# Needs Docker (host networking), git, kubectl.

This will DESTROY and REBUILD the entire Talos cluster:
  nodes : ${IPS[*]}
  wipe  : STATE + EPHEMERAL + u-longhorn + u-localpath  (ALL k8s state AND all Longhorn + local-path data, gone for good)
  flow  : commit+push -> reset -> 03d -> 03e -> 04 -> 05 -> restore sealed-secrets key -> WIPE S3 backups -> seed ntfy
          (ArgoCD then redeploys cilium/cert-manager/longhorn/gateway/SSO/monitoring from git)
  note  : FULL fresh start — wipes local CNPG data AND the S3 backups. The DBs come back EMPTY. If you want
          the old data, restore from S3 BEFORE rebuilding (make restore-cnpg); a rebuild discards it.

Have a CURRENT sealed-secrets key backup (06_backup_sealed_secrets_key.sh), else SSO won't decrypt
until you re-seal (07_google_sso). ntfy alerting is seeded post-boot via 10_ntfy_auth regardless.

# === STEP 9. converge ArgoCD (self-heal backstop) ============================
# Real self-healing does the work: each app's syncPolicy.retry (limit:-1, refresh) re-drives a failed sync
# until its dependency lands (a workload that raced ahead of the platform just retries until the CRD exists),
# selfHeal + the poll re-examine, and the CNPG ObjectStore is a persistent resource (not a helm hook) so
# nothing wedges. The converge step is the bootstrap backstop: it hard-refreshes EVERY app so it re-compares
# against this rebuild's pushed commit + the STEP-7 key restore right away (the webhook isn't up yet, the poll
# is 300s), and nudges any straggler to Synced+Healthy. Settle first so the platform has created its apps.
# Best-effort; never fails the rebuild. See 05_gitops.md.

# token is stale. 10_ntfy_auth.sh re-creates the phone/grafana users + ACLs and mints + re-seals a FRESH token;

# ArgoCD brings up the ingress stack (envoy-gateway -> gateway -> cert-manager -> apps) ASYNC after the
# ArgoCD bootstrap, and HTTP-01 issuance takes minutes, so "05 done" does NOT mean the sites work yet.
# verify_ingress (lib/shell/common.sh) polls each HTTPS host until it serves a REAL, LE-backed response over
# clean HTTP/2. Best-effort: warns (does not fail the rebuild) if it can't confirm within INGRESS_WAIT.

# === summary =================================================================
cat <<EOF

=============== cluster rebuilt ===============
ArgoCD is bootstrapped and reconciling every app from git (cilium adopt, cert-manager, longhorn,
envoy-gateway, gateway, SSO, monitoring). Watch it:
  KUBECONFIG=${KUBECONFIG_FILE} kubectl get applications -n argocd -w

Notes:
  - If the key restore (STEP 7) didn't run, do it once sealed-secrets is up
    (lib/shell/06_restore_sealed_secrets_key.sh), or re-seal with 07_google_sso and commit+push.
  - ntfy alerting: STEP 10 re-seeded it automatically (if NTFY_PHONE_PASSWORD_SECRET was set) — the reset wiped
    ntfy's PVC, so a fresh token was minted + re-sealed. If it was skipped/failed, run 'make configure-ntfy-auth'
    + commit/push + restart grafana. On your phone, re-subscribe 'cluster-alerts' at https://ntfy.ops.pontiki.app.
  - FULL FRESH START: the wipe cleared local-path AND the S3 backups (STEP 8). The DBs come back EMPTY and
    begin a clean backup history. If you wanted the old data, you had to restore BEFORE rebuilding
    (make restore-cnpg) — a rebuild discards it. The bucket + IAM stay; only \`make reset-cluster\` destroys them.
    See docs/13_backups.md.
  - TLS certs re-issue via HTTP-01; first issuance takes a few minutes. If you've rebuilt repeatedly,
    validate hosts on letsencrypt-staging before flipping to prod (tight rate limits).
