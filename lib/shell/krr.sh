# The image has no ENTRYPOINT, so passing args would REPLACE its whole command; hence --entrypoint python.
# The two extra -v mounts drop our strategy into the image's strategies package and replace its __init__.py
# with one that imports ours. KRR finds strategies by walking the subclasses of its base class, and a class
# only exists to be found once its module has been imported, so that import is what registers ours. No image
# rebuild needed.
# --mem-min 0 disables KRR's built-in memory floor, which applies to request AND limit alike, so the
# strategy owns the asymmetric floors instead.
